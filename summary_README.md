Here is the 1st task 
basically i have created my profile web page as a 1st task of this intership also uesd the syntax as mentioned :
a. <article> for a aparagraph type
b. <section> for section part.
c. and <h> for size of the text to increase or to decrese.
along with this i had added up and down buttons to go up or down to the page respectively.
and much more, this was about todays task 
as it is not so offical ( 1st day of the intership was excellent as a experience ).
thank you!
